-- Jarom Paskett's AI Game --
Your objective is to defeat all the enemies (red robots)

-- Controls --
Arrow keys - Move your character
Mouse Move - Aim
Mouse Click - Launch projectiles

-- Peer Review Feedback --
What feedback did you receive from your peers?
    Center the start message in the middle of the screen.
What improvements did you implement based on their feedback?
    I made it so the center of the text will render in the position given, with some difficulty getting the AI to understand font.render() correctly.

-- Pros & Cons --
Pros: How did AI help you in this project?
    AI helped speed up the code writing process and understanding the most efficient strategies for solutions to my problems.
Cons: What difficulties or limitations did you run into when using AI?
    One problem I had when using AI was that it sometimes would make inconsistent code, and I often had to change things or re-organize sections of code in the way that I thought was best. It was good for lobbing a large amount of busy-work code into my game, but refining it and getting things to work correctly the way I wanted it to was largely on me.
